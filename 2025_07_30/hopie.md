# My Amazing Trip to Can Tho City

## Introduction
I want to share with you about an incredible 2-day trip I had last month to **Can Tho City**.

**Can Tho City** is the largest city in Vietnam's Mekong Delta region, often called the "Rice Bowl of Vietnam." It's famous for its floating markets, beautiful rivers, and delicious local cuisine. The city serves as the economic and cultural center of the Mekong Delta, attracting visitors with its unique water-based lifestyle and traditional Vietnamese culture.
